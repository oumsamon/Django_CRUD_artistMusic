python   <===> node  (duh)

pip / pipenv  <==> npm / yarn

    general name: Package Manager

    similiarities:
        - they both do out to the internet to install pkgs by name
        - where do they go to lookup the pkg?
        - provide separation of pkg's

    differences:
        - node_modules installs in project directory;
            python installs to centralized site-packages

psycopg2  <==> mongoose

    allow our server runtime (python /js) 
    to communicate with our DB (postgres vs mongo)

django-admin  <===> npx create-react-app

    sets up the boilerplate for us to modify 


python uses:

    site-packages/

        this is code used in python programs

    Scripts/

        can be used on the command line
